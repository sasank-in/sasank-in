# 👋 Hi, I'm Sasank Nukala

🎓 **B.Tech in Computer Science (AI Minor)** — Lovely Professional University  
💡 Passionate about building intelligent systems for real-world applications in **Computer Vision**, **AI Model Deployment**, and **Backend Engineering**.

---

## 🧠 Focus Areas
- Applied **AI for Sports Analytics** (Tennis Match Analysis, Ball Tracking, Pose Estimation)  
- **Deep Learning Pipelines** for video and keypoint-based models  
- **Backend Engineering** with scalable, production-ready APIs  
- **Model Lifecycle Management** – from training to deployment

---

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
**Python**, **PyTorch**, **TensorFlow**, **OpenCV**, **YOLO**, **FastAPI**, **Django REST**, **Pandas**, **NumPy**, **Scikit-learn**, **SQLite / PostgreSQL**

---

## 📈 Notable Projects
- 🎾 **Tennis Match Analysis System**  
  End-to-end AI pipeline integrating YOLO-based detection and tracking for court, players, and ball.  
  *Includes bounce prediction and player pose recognition modules.*

- 🧍‍♂️ **Player Pose Classification Model**  
  KNN-based classifier trained on custom dataset of tennis poses — forehand, backhand, serve, and ready position.

- ⚡ **AI-Driven Calculator**  
  Handwritten digit recognition integrated with computational logic for gesture-based arithmetic.

---

## 🚀 What I'm Exploring
- Efficient model deployment using **ONNX / TensorRT**  
- Building lightweight **AI microservices** using **FastAPI + Celery + Redis**  
- Researching **real-time sports analytics** through motion tracking
