# 👋 Welcome to My GitHub

I’m **Sasank Nukala** — a backend and AI systems engineer focused on **modular architectures**, **computer vision automation**, and **reproducible intelligence workflows**.  
I design systems where every layer — from data to model inference — remains transparent, auditable, and precisely controllable.

My goal is to engineer AI pipelines that are **explainable by design**, combining backend precision with data-driven automation for robust and interpretable systems.
