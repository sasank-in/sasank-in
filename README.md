# 👋 Welcome to My GitHub

Hi, I’m **Sasank Nukala** — a systems-oriented engineer building **transparent, reproducible, and automation-ready AI infrastructures**.  
I specialize in **backend architecture**, **computer vision systems**, and **autonomous agent workflows** that unify data, models, and control logic into cohesive, production-grade pipelines.

My engineering mindset revolves around three principles:  
**clarity**, **control**, and **composability** — ensuring every process is explainable, traceable, and extensible from dataset to deployment.
